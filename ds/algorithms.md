# Algorithms

The algorithms classes I teach at Illinois have 2 significant prereq:
- a course on *discrete mathematics*
- a course on *fundamental data structures*

Familiarity with the following topics is required.

  - Logarithm Identities
  - Naive Set Theory
  - Boolean Algebra
  - First-Order Predicate Logic
  - Sets
  - Functions

  - Recursive Definitions
  - Tree (Abstract Data Type)
  - Graphs (Vertices, Edges)
* *Proof Theory*
  - Direct proof
  - Indirect proof
  - Contradiction
  - Exhaustive Case Analysis
  - Induction
    - Strong
    - Structural
* *Iterative programming concepts*
  - Variables
  - Conditionals
  - Loops
  - Records
  - Indirections
    - Addresses
    - Pointers
    - References

  - Recursion
* *Fundamental abstract data types*
  - Scalars
  - Sequences
  - Vectors
  - Sets
  - Stacks
  - Queues
  - Maps (Dictionaries)
  - Ordered Maps (Dictionaries)

    - singly-linked lists
    - doubly-linked lists
    - linear linked lists
    - circular linked lists
  - Balanced trees 
    - Binary Search Trees
    - AVL tree
    - Red-black tree
    - Treap
    - Skip list
    - Splay
  - Hash table
  - Binary heap
* *Fundamental computational problems*
  - Elementary arithmetic
  - Sorting
  - Searching

  - Binary searching
  - Sorting 
    - Selection sort
    - Insertion sort
    - Merge sort
    - Heap sort
    - Quicksort
    - Radix sort
  - Breadth-first search and
  - Depth-first search (at least in BST)
* *Elementary algorithm analysis*
  - Asymptotic notation (o, O, Θ, Ω, !),
  - Translating loops into sums 
  - Translating recursive calls into recurrences
  - Evaluating simple sums and recurrences
* *Mathematical maturity*
  - Abstractioning
  - Formal (recursive) definitions
  - Inductive proofs
  - Writing/following mathematical arguments
  - Recognizing syntactic, semantic or logical nonsense
