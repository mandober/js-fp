## Mathematical optimization

**Mathematical optimization** or **mathematical programming**, is studies the problems of selecting "the best" element, with regard to some criteria, in a set of all available alternatives.

**Optimization problem** is about finding the most optimal solution to an objective function, out of all feasible solutions.

*Discrete optimization* problem has variables that range over a discrete set of values, and it refers to searching for the optimal element/object (integer, permutation, graph) in a countable set.

*Combinatorial optimization* includes problems on discrete structures (such as graphs and matroids).

*Integer program* or *feasibility program* is an optimization problem with the type of variables being constrained to integers (only range over integers).


A *constraint* is a condition of an optimization problem that the solution must satisfy. Constraint can be equality, inequality and integer constraints.

A *feasible set* is a set of candidate solutions that satisfy all constraints.


Mathematical programming models a problem with 3 kinds of functions:

*Cost (loss) function* maps an event (or values of one or more variables) to a number (a real) in order to represent a certain "cost" associated with the event. An optimization problem seeks to minimize the cost function.

*Utility function* (reward/profit/fitness function) represents a notion which is to be maximized.

*Objective function* is either one of the two, depending whether a problem is modelled in a way to be minimized or maximized.


## Combinatorial optimization

**Combinatorial optimization** is a topic that consists of finding an optimal object from a finite set of objects. In many such problems, exhaustive search is not tractable. It operates on the domain of those optimization problems, in which the set of feasible solutions is discrete or can be reduced to discrete, and in which the goal is to find the best solution.

Some common problems involving combinatorial optimization are the travelling salesman problem ("TSP"), the minimum spanning tree problem ("MST"), and the knapsack problem.

Combinatorial optimization is a subset of mathematical optimization that is related to operations research, algorithm theory, and computational complexity theory. It has important applications in several fields, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, auction theory, and software engineering.

Some research literature considers discrete optimization to consist of integer programming together with combinatorial optimization (which in turn is composed of optimization problems dealing with graph structures) although all of these topics have closely intertwined research literature. It often involves determining the way to efficiently allocate resources used to find solutions to mathematical problems.
