/*
Trampoline in JS


- TRAMPOLINE is a loop that iteratively invokes thunk-returning fns (continuation-
  passing style).
- A single trampoline can express all control transfers in a program.
- A program so expressed is TRAMPOLINED, or in TRAMPOLINED STYLE.
- Converting a program to trampolined style is TRAMPOLINING.
- TRAMPOLINED FUNCTIONS are used to implement TAIL-RECURSIVE fn calls
  in stack-oriented languages.
